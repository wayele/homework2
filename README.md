# Responsive Portfolio
The goal of this project is to design a responsive a personal portfolio web applications that will render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. This web application has an about me page, portfolio page, and a contact page.

This web application uses html, css, and bootstrap elements for the different sections.  An additional css styling page was used on top of bootstrap styling.

# Web Application Components
The "About Me" page describes who Wube is and includes a picture. It has bootstraps elements including a navigation bar, grid layout to make it responsive, and a footer.
